DrivenWork is a platform that allows you to list and organize companies by the problems they solve.

I created this platform after getting this idea in my head if only there was a way to find jobs at companies organized by the problems they solved. Like any sensible person would do I purchased the domain and did nothing with it for a year.

Example: 
Tesla: Electric Cars, Solving Sustainable Energy.
CEO: Elon Musk
